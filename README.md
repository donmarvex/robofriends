# A Robofriends web app created with React

Live deployment can be found [_here_]()

The web app gets information about robot users through the {JSON} Placeholder API, which can be accessed  [_here_](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

As the user interacts with the search component, the robots automatically get updated depending on the input in the search field.

To run this project locally for development purposes you can fork or clone the repository, have Node installed on your machine, and then run the following commands in your terminal.
