[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d7b86032-a1c1-4047-84b5-7f2c8ee822e9/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/robofriendswithme/deploys)

Live deployment can be found on;
- Netlify [_here_](https://robofriendswithme.netlify.app/)

The web app gets information about robot users through the {JSON} Placeholder API, which can be accessed  [_here_](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and generated images from the Robohash API also [_here_](https://robohash.org)

As the user interacts with the search component, the robots automatically get updated depending on the input in the search field.
